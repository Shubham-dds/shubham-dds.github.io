## 🔧 Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is LiDAR?
LiDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging. It uses laser light to measure distances, creating detailed maps of the environment. 

### 2. Can I use any LiDAR device?
While P2M works with many LiDAR devices, ensure compatibility by checking the device's specifications.

### 3. How does P2M avoid obstacles?
P2M processes real-time data from the LiDAR device to detect obstacles and calculates the best path to navigate around them.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting 
If you encounter issues while using P2M, consider the following steps:

- **Check Device Connection**: Ensure that your LiDAR device is properly connected.
- **Review Settings**: Incorrect settings may affect navigation. Double-check the configured parameters.
- **Reinstall the Application**: If problems persist, consider uninstalling and reinstalling P2M.
